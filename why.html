   <p><strong>A Process of Accumulating Happiness:</strong> </p>
   <p>
    Life is a process of accumulating more happiness than sadness. <br/>
    Everyone has his/her own ways of gathering happiness: having ice cream in a summer day; playing basketball with friends; having dinner with family; marrying the one you love to the fullest.
    At the moment we were born, we're all entitled to have happiness. However, finding the true happiness is hard but worth doing.
    We are all confused from time to time whether I should do this or that. We all wonder what our purposes of lives are. Simply put, we all want to know what to do in the future.

   <p><strong> Talk to the wisers:
     </strong></p>
   <p>
     Then, where is the answer? you. Only by asking yourself, could you find out what kind of road is for your to embark on. But be careful, because of the chaotic society we live in and the enormous amount of information bombing us every day, every discovered happiness has to be certified by the "wisers". The wisers are the people who've talked to previous themselves. They've been through every stages of lives, experiencing and feeling the essence of lives. They're capable of telling whether a kind of happiness is true to each of us. And only the wiser can tell if a person has become a wiser or not. The wiser, Sam Tsai, will recognize next wisers once he meet them. Being wisers is a divine mission to spread the true happiness all over the world.
