   <p><strong>
   1st step: Talk to yourself
   </strong></p>
   <p>
   Talk to your self. Ask yourself what things make you happy and satisfied. Family? Friends? Wealth? Sports? Career? Ones of these are the sources of your happiness. 
   <br/>
     Close your eyes and review your past. Picture anything popping out your mind that made you feel happy and satisfied. Discard any expectation the society or your parents have been putting on you. You live for yourself. You're not living for fulfilling other's expectations. 
     <br/>
       Be true to yourself. What's the cause of you doing everything? What generates infinite happiness to you. Have you kept doing something regardless of the result or the reason why you did it? Then,  that's the happiness.
   </p>
   <p><strong> 
   2nd step: talk to the wisers
   </strong></p>
   <p>
    Once you think something might be your true happiness, talk to the wisers.
    <br/>
      The wisers would examine the reasons why you choose this as your happiness. By seeing through you, the wisers would detect whether you're still fooled and deceived by the turbulent society. You have to and should trust the wisers because they've been through all kinds of feeling a human could have. Therefore, the wisers are capable of differentiating happiness from other emotions. They are your guiders toward the happiness. 
     
   </p>
   <p><strong> 
   3rd step: write it down on the Hible
   </strong></p>
   <p>
      Once the wisers certify your true happiness, they will record it in the Hible - a online book recording every Hedonist's sources of happiness - the ultimate origin of happiness. The essence of Hedonion. 
   </p>
   <p><strong> Last step: do it
     </strong></p>
      <p>
      Once your happiness is recorded in the Hible, do it. Gain as much happiness as you can in this life. Then, you'll make your next life full of much more happiness.
