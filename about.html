      <strong>The Origin of Hedonion:</strong>
      </p>
         <p>
            Hedonion was found in 2014 by Sam Tsai. Tsai revealed his conversation with the previous himself to the world: "You've lived your life again and again, and better and better." (The original word are Chinese) The previous Tsai told Tsai. 
            <br/><br/>
              Because of the conversation, Tsai realized that the meaning of our lives lie in the happiness we accumulate in every one of our lives. The more happiness we accumulate in this life, the happier we would be in the next life.

         <strong>The feeling of happiness:</strong>
         </p>
         <p>
         We feel happy. Feeling happy is the ultimate objective of our lives. The way we feel happy is the same as the previous us and the next us feel happy. If we suffer from any difficulty without facing and coping with it, it means the previous us warded off the challenge, thus leaving the you experience the pain again. If we do not face the difficulty again, we will let the following us suffer it again and again to the infinity. The vicious chain should and can be broken by your change - Make you life better by the now you.
